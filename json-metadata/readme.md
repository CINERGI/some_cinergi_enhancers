# ...because metadata is the engine of data discovery and reuse...

Ryan Clark started a JSON encoding of a generic metadata model that incorporates concepts from ISO19115, ISO19119, FRBR, and FGDC CSDGM in 2012. The entry-point for his initial work is a [JSON-schema](http://json-schema.org) document located [here on Github](http://raw.github.com/usgin/json-metadata/master/schemas/metadataRecord.json).

A [new JSON schema for science resource metadata](https://github.com/usgin/json-metadata/blob/master/USGINMetadataJSONschema.json) based on draft-4 of the JSON schema RFC has now been generated, including content for a comprehensive suite of metadata properties from ISO19115, ISO19119, ISO19110, ISO19157, and FGDC CSDGM.

A [UML model for some key metadata elements]( 
http://usgin.github.io/usginspecs/metadataModel/index.htm) provides an overview of the content.
