This final action includes our responses to comments on our proposed FIP published in the Federal Register on February 18, 2014. This final rule, together with a final rule published in the Federal Register on December 5, 2012, completes our FIP for the disapproved portions of Arizona's RH SIP. This final rule addresses the RHR's requirements for Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART), Reasonable Progress (RP), and a Long-term Strategy (LTS) as well as the interstate visibility transport requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for pollutants that affect visibility in Arizona's 12 Class I areas and areas in nearby states. The BART sources addressed in this final FIP are Tucson Electric Power (TEP) Sundt Generating Station Unit 4, Lhoist North America (LNA) Nelson Lime Plant Kilns 1 and 2, ASARCO Incorporated Hayden Smelter, and Freeport-McMoRan Incorporated (FMMI) Miami Smelter. The reasonable progress sources addressed in the FIP are Phoenix Cement Company (PCC) Clarkdale Plant Kiln 4 and CalPortland Cement (CPC) Rillito Plant Kiln 4. EPA is prepared to work with the State on a SIP revision that would replace some or all elements of the FIP.",

EPA's redesignation of the Hayden area is based on recorded violations of the Pb standards at the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality's (ADEQ's) Globe Highway monitoring site, located near the towns of Hayden and Winkleman, Arizona, and additional relevant air quality information. The effect of this action will be to redesignate the Hayden area to nonattainment for the Pb standards and thereby to impose certain planning requirements on the State of Arizona to reduce Pb concentrations within the Hayden area, including, but not limited to, the requirement to submit, within 18 months of redesignation, a revision to the Arizona state implementation plan (SIP) that provides for attainment of the Pb standards as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than five years after the effective date of this redesignation.",

The legislature of Arizona enacted a fall protection standard for residential roofing that provides fall protection at heights above 15 feet, while that of OSHA provides protection to workers at 6 feet. OSHA is proposing to take action to require Arizona to revise its standard to provide equivalent protection. OSHA is initiating two concurrent administrative proceedings which would officially reject Arizona's fall protection standard, and rescind the ``final approval'' status of the Arizona state plan in the construction industry, to allow OSHA to enforce Federal construction safety standards pending enactment by Arizona of an ``at least as effective'' fall protection standard. OSHA is soliciting written comments to ensure that all relevant information, views and data are available to the Assistant Secretary. If requested, a public hearing may be held on these issues.",
