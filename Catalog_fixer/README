The Catalog Fixer runs through the catalog located at http://hydro10.sdsc.edu/HLIResources/Resources
and finds resources that have errors that need to be addressed. The Fixer outputs a text file listing
the resources with issues, their issues, the page number they can be found on and the link provided
for the resource.

There are various classes of issues including being a duplicate of another resource (title or link fields
are the same), having a bad url, having only an acronym in the title, having all lowercase letters in the
title, missing an abstract, missing a source to the abstract, or missing a brief description.

Each issue has an associated severity with url related issues being the highest severity, title and missing
abstract issues being of moderate severity (including being a duplicate) and all other issues being of lowest
severity. (Please not this paragraph is not exhaustive of all the issues a resource can have and what
severities they have) Issues are output in order of severity.

Because there is no direct access to the database, this fixer cannot update resources. It can only point out
issues to a human curator who will then have to manually address these issues.
